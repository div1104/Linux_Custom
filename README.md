Linux_Custom Script Task

here i made different files for each part and executed them seperately such that it can be easily understandable

note: some of the code is taken through internet and modified according to the need of task assigned

due to lack of time i am not able to attach the screenshots of the ouput here but i am uploaded all the code snipets required for the task
sorry for the inconvinience
